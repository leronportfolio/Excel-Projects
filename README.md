Project Overview
This project involves working with raw data to create a meaningful dashboard in Excel. The steps undertaken include:

Importing the Raw Data: Open Microsoft Excel and import the raw data into a new worksheet.

Creating a Working Sheet: To prevent accidental changes to the raw data, create a separate working sheet where you can perform data cleaning and analysis.

Data Cleaning: Identify and eliminate any duplicates in the dataset. Format the data appropriately to ensure clarity and ease of analysis.

Creating Pivot Tables:

Average Income by Gender: Create a pivot table to analyze and compare the average income based on gender.

Bike Purchase Decision by Age: Build another pivot table to examine the relationship between bike purchase decisions and age brackets.

Distance Analysis by Bike Purchase: Create a pivot table to determine the distance traveled based on the bike purchase decision.

Building the Dashboard: Consolidate the pivot tables onto a new sheet to create a visually appealing and informative dashboard.

Adding Interactivity: Enhance the dashboard by incorporating interactive features such as filters. These filters will allow users to change how the data is displayed based on their preferences.
